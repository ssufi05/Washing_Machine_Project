# Washing_Machine_Project

•
I have worked on a team project where we create a project domain in which
we identify and formulate a domain's Minimum Viable Product requirements
and constraints.
•
Using these requirements, we created use cases with priority weight
indicators as well as a Requirements - Use Case Traceability Matrix
•
In addition, we created a domain model, UML class diagram as well as an
Actor-System interaction model of our top three use cases
•
Finally, we implemented the domain into a sequence diagram and narrative
to explain and show the control structures between the created objects
